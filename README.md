🔹 I'm a First Class Honours graduate in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from Heriot-Watt University, Dubai.

🔹 I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through AI, robotics, full-stack applications, and game development. Whether it's building assistive tech for the visually impaired using YOLOv11 and MiDaS, simulating intelligent robot behavior using Genetic Algorithms in Webots, or creating physics-based 3D games in Unity—I love turning complex ideas into working systems.

🔹 I've worked with a wide range of technologies including Python, Kotlin, TensorFlow, PyTorch, React.js, Webots, Unity, and more. I enjoy bridging research and practical application, often building solutions that run directly on mobile or edge devices using TensorFlow Lite.

🔹 In my spare time, I explore game mechanics and storytelling through interactive projects, some of which have earned international recognition like an Honourable Mention in NASA's Space Apps Challenge.

I'm always open to collaborating on exciting projects—especially those at the intersection of AI and Game design, as well as any impactful project!
